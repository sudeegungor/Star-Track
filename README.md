# Star-Track

 	The aim of the project is to develop a robot "space maze" game, 
  
 	in which treasures are collected while walking in it.
  
 	The game is played in a 23*55 game field including walls. There are two competitors: Player (P) and Computer (C).
  
  There are some treasures/numbers in the game, which the players collect to increase their scores. The aim of the game is gaining the highest end-game score.
